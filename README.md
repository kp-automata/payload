# Aerosol Optical Depth and Hyperspectral Imaging

### What is aerosol optical depth (AOD)?
In essence, AOD is the measurement of various aerosols within a given atmosphereic vertical column. Specific definintions can 
differ slightly depending on whether the sensing instrument is located on Earth's surface or above in a low-earth-orbit satellite. It is vital to note that AOD is a natural logarimic ratio and is not considered in terms of dimensionality/area. The first logical step in generating AOD is the Beer-Lambert-Law.





With the goal of extracting information solely targetting aersol content, several other atmosphereic elements need to subtracted from the initial
total measurment.
