# Aerosol Optical Depth and Hyperspectral Imaging

### What is aerosol optical depth (AOD)?
In essence, aerosol optical depth is the measurement of various aerosols within a given atmospheric vertical column. Specific definitions can 
differ slightly depending on whether the sensing instrument is located on Earth's surface or above in a low-earth-orbit satellite. Notably, AOD is the natural logarithmic *ratio* of incident to transmitted radiant power through a given wavelength sample. It is not to be considered in terms of dimensionality/area. 

The first logical step in generating AOD is the Beer-Lambert-Law.

$$V_{\lambda} = V$$



With the goal of extracting information solely targeting aerosol content, several other atmospheric elements need to subtracted from the initial
*total* measurement. 

Finally, we consider the *angstrom parameter*. This will allow us to discern the size distribution of aerosol in our results. If we take the first derivative of the logarithmic ratio of the above aerosol *total* measurement and the given wavelength we get the angstrom parameter, typically referred to as $$\alpha$$. Values of $$\alpha$$ $$\gt$$ 2.0 show us finer particulates while $$\alpha$$ being close to zero alerts us to the presense of coarse particulates.
